= image:./small-arc42-logo.png[arc42] Generator for Template Formats

If you want to use an arc42 template for your system, you **don't need to use this repo** -
just use one of the templates you find on http://arc42.org/download.

== General Overview

The content (structure + embedded-help) of the arc42 template are maintained
in the http://github.com/arc42/arc42-template repository. We call that one
the **Golden-Master**


== How to use this Project


This repository contains a Groovy-based build system to convert the golden master into other formats. The build system uses standalone Groovy scripts for template generation, format conversion, and distribution packaging.

To create the other formats from the "Golden Master", you can now use GitHub Codespaces:

1. Open the project in a GitHub Codespace:

- In the GitHub repository, click on "Code" and then "Codespaces" → "Create codespace on master".
- The Codespace will start a cloud development environment.
- In the Codespace terminal, run:

         ./build-arc42.sh

This will automatically generate all required formats. The results can be found in the `/build` directory.

Alternatively, you can follow these manual steps on your local machine:
    
1. Clone this repository:

    git clone git@github.com:arc42/arc42-generator.git

2. Add the "Golden Master" templates by initializing the git submodule and update them

   cd arc42-generator
   git submodule update -i
   cd arc42-template
   git checkout master
   git pull
   cd ..

3. Create derived versions from the "Golden Master"

   groovy build.groovy templates

+
This will extract the "plain" and "with-help"-version from the golden master. You'll find the
templates in different languages in +build\src_gen+ in AsciiDoc format. The system automatically
discovers all available languages (currently 9: CZ, DE, EN, ES, FR, IT, NL, PT, RU).

4. Convert templates to other formats:

    groovy build.groovy convert

+
This will generate all other formats, i.e. HTML, docx, and markdown.
The results are created in the `/build` directory, organized by language and format.

5. Now you can create the distribution:

    groovy build.groovy distribution

+
This will create the 'arc42-template/dist' directory with all downloadable
versions, nicely compressed as ZIP files.

+
**Shortcut**: Run all three phases at once with:

    groovy build.groovy

+
Or run the automated script that also handles Pandoc installation and submodule updates:

    ./build-arc42.sh

6. Now you should cross-check, test, verify the generated files :-)

7. Finally you can commit and push these to the arc42-template repository:

    cd arc42-template
    git commit -m "<commit comment>" *.zip
    git push https://github.com/arc42/arc42-template.git


=== System Requirements

* http://groovy-lang.org[Groovy] version 4.0 or higher (tested with 5.0.2)
  - Install via https://sdkman.io[SDKMAN]: `sdk install groovy`
* Java Runtime (version 11 or higher recommended, tested with OpenJDK 21)
* http://pandoc.org[pandoc] installed with version 3.0 or higher (tested with 3.7.0.2)
  - The `build-arc42.sh` script will automatically install Pandoc if missing

As some of the build steps require **locally installed additional tools**
(like Groovy and Pandoc), you might encounter errors if these are missing on your system.
