= image:./small-arc42-logo.png[arc42] Generator for Template Formats

If you want to use an arc42 template for your system, you **don't need to use this repo** -
just use one of the templates you find on http://arc42.org/download.

== General Overview

The content (structure + embedded-help) of the arc42 template are maintained
in the http://github.com/arc42/arc42-template repository. We call that one
the **Golden-Master**


== How to use this Project


This repository contains a gradle project to convert the golden master into other formats. In order to make it really easy to use this gradle project, the repository includes the gradle-wrapper - a script which will automatically install gradle for you if it is not already installed.

To create the other formats from the "Golden Master", you can now use GitHub Codespaces:

1. Open the project in a GitHub Codespace:

- In the GitHub repository, click on "Code" and then "Codespaces" → "Create codespace on master".
- The Codespace will start a cloud development environment.
- In the Codespace terminal, run:

         ./build-arc42.sh

This will automatically generate all required formats. The results can be found in the `/build` directory.

Alternatively, you can follow these manual steps on your local machine:
    
1. Clone this repository:

    git clone git@github.com:arc42/arc42-generator.git

2. Add the "Golden Master" templates by initializing the git submodule and update them

   cd arc42-generator
   git submodule update -i
   cd arc42-template
   git checkout master
   git pull
   cd ..

3. Create derived versions from the "Golden Master"

   ./gradlew createTemplatesFromGoldenMaster

+
This will extract the "plain" and "with-help"-version from the golden master. You'll find the
templates in different languages in +build\src_gen+ in AsciiDoc format.

+
Btw: gradle allows you to "shorten" the command - as long as gradle is still able to guess the command,
anything goes :-).  `./gradlew createT` is as valid as `./gradlew cTFGM`.

4. After you have executed the task to create the templates, a new task will become available in gradle:

    ./gradlew arc42

+
This will generate all other formats, i.e. docx and markdown.
The results are created the `/build` directory.

5. Now you can create the distribution:

    ./gradlew createDistribution

+
This will create the 'arc42-template/dist' directory with all downloadable
versions, nicely compressed.

6. Now you should cross-check, test, verify the generated files :-)

7. Finally you can commit and push these to the arc42-template repository:

    cd arc42-template
    git commit -m "<commit comment>" *.zip
    git push https://github.com/arc42/arc42-template.git


=== System Requirements

* Java Runtime (everything above 1.7 should work)
* http://pandoc.org[pandoc] installed with version 1.12.4.2 or higher

As some of the build steps require **locally installed additional tools*
(like pandoc), you might encounter errors if these are missing on your system.


== General Requirements
We collected the +arc42+ link:docs/arc42-requirements.adoc[requirements
in a separate document].



== Template Downloads
For template downloads please see the https://github.com/arc42/arc42-template[arc42-template]
repository or the official download page on http://arc42.org/download.
